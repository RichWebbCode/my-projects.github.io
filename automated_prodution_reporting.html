                <p>When you work in a brewery, you find a large amount of time is taken up with finding data,
                    filling out reports and trying to figure out what is working well and how to keep it going.
                </p>
                <p>Each week I saw our brewing team spending hours sat in front of screen and sifting through paper, to find
                    the information they needed to enter into a spreadsheet and produce reports. So I got to work building an automation
                    tool to get them out frm behind the monitor and spending their time making our beer as great as it could be.
                </p>
                <p>The first set was to remove as mouch of the paper reporting as possible and get the information entered 
                    into Brewman, our brewery management software.
                </p>
                <p>Next I needed a way to get the data out of Brewman. An API would have been perfect, but Brewman didn't have 
                    an API for the production side of their software. They built an API for the sales data to be used with accounting 
                    software. After speaking with Premier Systems, the company that makes Brewman, they said they were interested in
                    building an API for the production data but it would take quite a bit of time to put in place.
                </p>
                <p>The only option I could see was to build an automation and web scapping tool to get the data.</p>
                <p>After sitting down with our Production Manager, I had a very long list of pages used to find the data. Luckily most of 
                    the data could be exported into a CSV file.
                </p>

            <div class="image-on-right">
                <img src="" alt="">

        </div>

        <div class="section-with-image-and-text">
            <div class="image-on-left">
                <img src="" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="text-on-right">
                <p>I started in Python and used the Selenium module to control a Chrome browser. I got it to navigate to Brewman and log in using my credientials.
                    I planned to build this into an app in the future, so I saved my log in details in a seperate JSON file, just incase anyone found them while looking
                    at my code.</p>
                <p>Once the login was successful, I ran it a few times and came accross my first problem. Our Brewman package only allows for 15 concurrent users.
                    When you have a sales team entering orders, driver logging deliveries and brewers posting data, this can fill up quite fast. When you hit 15 users,
                    there is a pop-up asking you to boot someone out of the system. You select from a list of users currently logged in and there is a list of how many
                    minutes that user has been inactive. We have a rule that you never log out a driver, because they are often inactive for long periods, between 
                    each drop. I would need to build some logic into the system, that could pick the user who had been inactive the longest and wasn't someone
                    who was delivering. The drivers aren't always a set list of users. If we're having a busy week, anyone can be drafted in to deliver beer. 
                    To get the minimum viable version of OLIVER up and running, I decided to push this to one side for now and if OLIVER flagged an error when logging in, I would go to Brewman
                    and choose which user to log out. I would return to this later.

                <p>Keeping track of what OLIVER was doing started to become a bit complicated. One incorrect action would have a domino effect. One wrong automated 
                    click in the wrong HTML path and nothing would work.</p>
                <p>I used a lot of print statements to keep track of what was happening. This allowed me to see at what point my script logic would fail and in the 
                    beginning, it failed a lot.
                </p>
                <p>Keeping track of all the print statements started to become very difficult, so I wrong a short function in Python to colour, timestamp and note 
                    the line number for each print statement. This worked brilliantly. It may be my dyslexia, scotopic sensitivity or just that reading line after 
                    line of print statements is tough on the eyes, but this was a game changer and made it so easy to pick out what was happening and at what point.
                    I reused a lot of functions in the program, so being able to easily keep track of what was making my script fail, sped up my work flow.
                </p>
                <p>Here's the code snippet for my print statements.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-python">
                    ### Print Statement Decorator
                    def print_t(message):
                        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
                        frame_info = inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe().f_back)
                        line_number = frame_info.lineno
                    
                        # ANSI escape codes for text color
                        #colors = ['\033[91m', '\033[92m']  # Red and Green Use for Christmas
                        colors = [
                            '\033[91m',         # Red
                            '\033[38;5;208m',   # Orange
                            '\033[93m',         # Yellow
                            '\033[92m',         # Green
                            '\033[96m',         # Cyan
                            '\033[94m',         # Blue
                            '\033[35m',         # Purple
                            '\033[95m',         # Magenta        
                        ]
                        reset_color = '\033[0m'
                    
                        # Alternate the color index with each print statement
                        print_t.color_index = (print_t.color_index + 1) % len(colors)
                    
                        colored_message = f'{colors[print_t.color_index]}Line {line_number}  {message} [{timestamp}]{reset_color}'
                        print(colored_message)
                    
                    # Initialize color_index attribute
                    print_t.color_index = 0
                </code></pre>
                <p>After this code snippet, use the function 'print_t' with your print statement after it and you'll be bathed in a sea of colourful, timestamped
                    print statements with a not of the line the print statement is on.

            <p>Once I logged in and could keep track of the print statements, I relised I didn't need to give OLIVER complicated instructions on where to click 
                to navigate to the right page, I could simply provide a list of URL's for OLIVER to navigate straight to the right page.
            </p>
            <p>I could get most of the data about how much beer was brewed from an export in the reporting section. The reports are run in Tableau, embedded into 
                Brewman. I needed to instruct OLIVER to change screen levels to select the export options. I decided to export the data in the format that it appeared 
                when the report loaded. My concern was that I have no control over how the report is structured. If there is an update to the file structure of the report
                I would be left having to go in and constantly update the automation paths. As much as I loved building OLIVER, I didn't want to have to keep
                going back and updating HTML paths.
            </p>
            <p>Once the report was exported, it landed in the users download directory. I then saved this to a SharePoint site using the Microsoft Graph API.</p>
            <p>This was fine for the first upload. The report contained the last 12 weeks data, but going forward, this would run every week.</p>
