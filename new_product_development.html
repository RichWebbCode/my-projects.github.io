                <p>So, picture this: you're in a bustling brewery, everyone's hyped about the latest beer
                    creation, and
                    bam! Communication magic happens, making the whole process smoother than ever. That's what
                    HOPSIGHT
                    is all about.</p>
                <p>HOPSIGHT, aka Holistic Optimisation and Process Synchronisation for Improved
                    Growth, Harmonisation, and Tasting. Fancy name, right? But it's more than just jargon; it's
                    our
                    solution to streamline how we track and communicate information on new product development.
                </p>
                <p>We're talking SharePoint Lists and Power Automate, folks. With these tools, we're turning the
                    chaos
                    of product management into a well-oiled machine. From conception to the shelves, we're
                    keeping
                    everyone in the loop, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.</p>

            <p>Each section has records with information that is passed on to the next person/department, in
                order to plan their tasks and prepare for the new beer</p>
            <p>To allow each entry in HOPSIGHT to contain as much data as possible without changing the way
                anyone performs the role.
                I included field with URL links. This can be used to link to a SharePoint file or folder.
            </p>
            <p>It also sends an email to every memeber of the team if a launch event is planned. It tells
                them the
                venue, time and date. The goal is to get for of the team to events to create a more social
                workplace.</p>

        <div class="section-with-text-and-image">
            <div class="text-on-left">
                <p>To pass the information on automatically, I added in tick boxes to flag to Power Automate
                    that
                    it's time to send an email. This was the simpliest way ang gave the user control over when
                    they were
                    ready to send out their data.</p>
                <p>Building a flow in Power Automate was relativley simple. I connected a condition to each
                    email that
                    is sent, which checks if the required data has been filled out and if the next stage box has
                    been
                    ticked. The
                    email that is sent contains all the data the next person/department in the chain along with
                    a link
                    to the
                    product in HOPSIGHT.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-on-right">
                <img src="hopsight.png" alt="HOPSIGHT">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section-with-image-and-text">
            <div class="image-on-left">
                <img src="hopsight.png" alt="HOPSIGHT">
            </div>
            <div class="text-on-right"></div>
            <p>Once a product has lived its life and the decsion comes to no longer make it, a De-list box
                is ticked. This serves the duel function to make sure no flow is triggered in Power Automate
                and to filter down the main list.
                When HOPSIGHT loads, rather than seeing a list of 100's of beers, this narrows down the list
                to the beers currently in production.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>And the best part? I'm just getting started. Imagine a future where HOPSIGHT talks directly to
            our
            brewery management software, ePOS, and website. Utilising their API's, no more manual data entry
            â€“
            just seamless, automated bliss.</p>
