                <p>Brief:</p>
                <p>Build a solution that will allow for tracking and communication of the products. Automatically
                    sending relient inforamtion to each department.</p>
                <p>Code Name: HOPSIGHT</p>
                <p>Holistic Optimisation and Process Synchronisation for Improved Growth, Harmonisation, and Tasting</p>
                <p>Bulit Using: SharePoint Lists, Power Automate</p>
                <p>In any business that regularly creates new products, communication is key. From conception to sales
                    can be a bumpy journey. The more information each member of the team have, the better they can
                    prepare.</p>
                <p>Starting with a SharePoint list, I made sections for Conception, Trail Batch, Brewing,
                    Automated SKU generation, barcode logging, Mareketing, Retail and De-listing</p>
                <p>Each section has records with information that is passed on to the next person/department, in order
                    to plan their tasks and prepare for the new beer</p>
                <p>To allow each entry in HOPSIGHT to contain as much data as possible without changing the way anyone
                    performs the role.
                    I included field with URL links. This can be used to link to a SharePoint file or folder.</p>
                <p>It also sends an email to every memeber of the team if a launch event is planned. It tells them the
                    venue, time and date. The goal is to get for of the team to events to create a more social
                    workplace.</p>
                <p>To pass the information on automatically, I added in tick boxes to flag to Power Automate that
                    it's time to send an email. This was the simpliest way ang gave the user control over when they were
                    ready to send out their data.</p>
                <p>Building a flow in Power Automate was relativley simple. I connected a condition to each email that
                    is sent,
                    which checks if the required data has been filled out and if the next stage box has been ticked. The
                    email
                    that is sent contains all the data the next person/department in the chain along with a link to the
                    product in
                    HOPSIGHT.</p>
                <p>Once a product has lived its life and the decsion comes to no longer make it, a De-list box is
                    ticked. This serves the
                    duel function to make sure no flow is triggered in Power Automate and to filter down the main list.
                    When HOPSIGHT loads, rather than seeing a list of 100's of beers, this narrows down the list to the beers 
                    currently in production. </p>
