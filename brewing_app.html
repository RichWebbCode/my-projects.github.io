            <h3> Upgrading The Brewing Experience: From Paper Recipes to Digital Precision</h3>
            <div class="project-description">
                <p>In the heart of every brewery lies not just the art of crafting beer, but also the essence of
                    customer interaction and satisfaction. For years, at Stewart Brewing, our brewers have helped
                    customer brew their own bespoke beers and diligently recorded customer recipes on paper during
                    brewing sessions, a tradition that fostered a personal touch but sometimes left room for
                    inefficiency. However, as technology evolved, so did our brewing experience, leading to a
                    transformation that seamlessly blends tradition with innovation.</p>
                <p>Picture this: brewers jotting down meticulous details on paper while customers eagerly participate in
                    the brewing process, immersing themselves in the magic of beer-making. But as the session concluded,
                    the paper recipe would often be left behind, triggering a familiar scenario where customers would
                    later request a copy via email. While this ritual added a nostalgic charm, it also hinted at an
                    opportunity for enhancement.</p>
                <p>Enter Power Apps, the game-changer in our quest for operational excellence and customer delight.
                    Leveraging the power of this versatile tool, I crafted a bespoke canvas app designed to
                    revolutionise the brewing experience at Stewart Brewing. Gone are the days of manual calculations
                    and guesswork; our app now calculates key parameters such as colour, bitterness, and fermentability
                    with unparalleled precision.</p>
                <p>The Brewing Experience app links with SharePoint lists so that the brewers can keep the ingredients up to date
                    with our current stock. They simply add in the new ingredients and the app will update after a minute. If that's 
                    not quick enough, I added refresh buttons to instantly get the latest ingredients list.</p>
                <p>The benefits were immediate and manifold. With just a few taps, brewers could input data and receive
                    instant feedback, empowering them to make informed decisions and ensure consistency across batches.
                    No longer did they have to rely solely on experience; the app provided a reliable guide, especially
                    valuable for newcomers finding their footing in the craft.</p>
                <p>But the transformation didn't stop there. Incorporating a feature to capture moments during the
                    brewing process added a personalised touch to the experience. A simple snap captured the camaraderie
                    and passion shared between brewers and customers, immortalising the journey in a single frame. And
                    with the ability to email the recipe along with the photo directly to customers, we ensured that
                    every brewing session became a cherished memory to be revisited time and again.</p>
                <p> When the customers brew session is finished and the customer has recieved their recipe, the brewers can
                    email and fermention labels, used to keep track of each beer during it's fermentation, conditioning and packaging
                    stages. This removes the chance of mistakes on hand written labels, give consitent data and takes care of 
                    fustration of having to dechiper doggy hand writing.</p>
                <p>The response was overwhelmingly positive. Customers marveled at the seamless integration of
                    technology into their brewing journey, while brewers embraced the newfound efficiency without
                    sacrificing the essence of personal interaction. What started as a quest for optimisation became a
                    testament to our commitment to innovation and customer-centricity.</p>
                <p>As I look ahead, I plan to expand the Brewing App to keep track of each brews process. Instead of using fermentation
                    labels, we could number the fermentation vessel or even use QR codes to find the current beer and track the 
                    progress in the app. I also want to add in quality control checks.</p>
                <p> There's also scope to add in automation to the fermention, conditioning and packaging stages. Imagine getting a 
                    daily list of beers to check on and record the progress. Each brewer would no longer have to leave hand over notes
                    on which beer they've checked and actions to take next. The app could give a list of things to do. Freeing up
                    our brewers time to allow them to focus on developing new recipes and making great beer</p>
